  - type: table
  description: Removes all key-value pairs from *table*.
  name: clear
  type: command
- arguments:
  - type: list
  description: Counts the occurrences of each element of the given list and reports the counts in a table.
  name: counts
  returns: table
  type: reporter
- arguments:
  - type: agentset
  - type: reporter
  description: |2

    Groups the agents in the agentset based on the given reporter.
    Agents that report the same thing for reporter will be grouped together.
    The results of the reporter will be used as the keys in the resulting table and the groups will be agentsets.

    For example:

    {{! prevent mustache from interpreting extension object as template variable }}{{= | | =}}
    ```
    observer> create-turtles 100 [ set color one-of [ red green blue ] ]
    observer> show table:group-agents turtles [ color ]
    observer: {{table: [[105 (agentset, 38 turtles)] [55 (agentset, 32 turtles)] [15 (agentset, 30 turtles)]]}}
    ```
  name: group-agents
  returns: table
  type: reporter
- arguments:
  - type: list
  - type: anonymous-reporter
  description: |2

    Groups the items of the list based on the given reporter.
    The reporter should take a single argument, which will be the items of the list.
    Items that report the same thing when passed to the reporter will be grouped together.
    The results of the reporter will be used as the keys in the resulting table and the groups will be lists.

    For example:

    {{! prevent mustache from interpreting extension object as template variable }}{{= | | =}}
    ```
    observer> show table:group-items range 10 [ num -> num mod 3 ]
    observer: {{table: [[0 [0 3 6 9]] [1 [1 4 7]] [2 [2 5 8]]]}}
    ```
